# Expert Full Stack Developer

Welcome! I am a full stack developer with extensive experience in building high-impact applications using the latest technologies and industry best practices. Throughout my career, I have worked on scalable projects, implementing modern architectures that enable efficient, flexible, and maintainable development.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Redux, Zustand, React Hook Form, Styled Components
- **Backend**: NestJS, Node.js, Express, REST APIs, GraphQL
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **DevOps and CI/CD**: Docker, AWS, Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
- **Micro Frontends**: Expertise in micro frontend architecture, enabling independent development and deployment of different parts of large-scale applications.
- **Monorepos**: Leveraging Turborepo to manage multiple applications or services within a single repository, ensuring consistency, optimization, and ease of maintenance.
- **Testing**: Unit Testing with Jest, Testing Library, E2E with Cypress

## Key Experience

### Scalable Application Development
I have led the creation of robust and scalable applications using **React.js** and **Next.js**, applying the latest updates and industry features such as **React Server Components** and performance optimization in **static and dynamic rendering**.

### Micro Frontend Architecture
In large-scale projects, I successfully implemented **micro frontend architecture**, allowing multiple teams to work in parallel on different parts of the application. This improves development scalability and facilitates the independent maintenance and deployment of components.

### Monorepos and Modularization
Using **Turborepo** and other tools, I have managed monorepos that group various projects (applications and libraries) into a single repository, ensuring code reuse, dependency consistency, and optimizing the CI/CD workflow.

### Scalable Backend with NestJS
With **NestJS**, I have designed and developed **robust APIs** that integrate with microservices and relational/non-relational databases, ensuring high availability and performance while following best design patterns like **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID** principles.

### DevOps and Continuous Integration
My experience includes designing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment, testing, and continuous monitoring, ensuring every change goes through a rigorous quality flow before reaching production. This allows for rapid and reliable iterations.

## Key Skills

- **Focus on Scalability**: Specialized in building solutions that scale efficiently to handle large data volumes and traffic.
- **Solid Architectures**: Implementation of advanced architectures such as **Clean Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and **Event-Driven Architecture**.
- **Performance Optimization**: Expert in analyzing and optimizing applications to reduce latency, improve load times, and enhance user experience.
- **Collaboration and Leadership**: Extensive experience working with cross-functional teams, leading efforts to deliver high-quality solutions.

## Work Philosophy

My goal is to always create solutions that not only work well today but are also easy to maintain and scale in the future. I firmly believe in using best practices, design patterns, and the latest standards to ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and ready for growth.
